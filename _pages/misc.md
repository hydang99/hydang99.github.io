## üöÄ Personal Projects & Activities

I have a passion for community involvement, especially in exciting projects that make a difference. Below are some projects and activities that I've engaged in and am proud of. Please feel free to contact me if you want to work together or share interesting ideas to support communities!

### üë• Student Leadership
<div class="misc-card">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #007bff;"><i class="fas fa-users" style="margin-right: 8px;"></i>Vietnamese Student Association, TCU (2018-2019)</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><i class="fas fa-heart" style="color: #dc3545; margin-right: 8px;"></i>This was such a rewarding experience! As Vice President, I got to work closely with our Vietnamese student community at TCU. We organized amazing cultural events that brought together students from all backgrounds - from traditional Tet celebrations to modern Vietnamese pop culture nights. The best part was seeing how these events helped international students feel more at home and created lasting friendships across cultures.</p>

### üå± Environmental Education & Conservation
<div class="misc-card">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #28a745;"><i class="fas fa-leaf" style="margin-right: 8px;"></i>TCU Rhino Initiative - Study Abroad, South Africa (2020)</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><i class="fas fa-globe-africa" style="color: #28a745; margin-right: 8px;"></i>What an incredible adventure this was! I spent time in South Africa working with the <a href="https://environment.tcu.edu/research-initiatives/rhino-conservation-in-south-africa/" target="_blank"><strong>TCU Rhino Initiative</strong></a>, where I got to see these magnificent creatures up close while helping protect them. The experience was eye-opening - I learned so much about wildlife conservation and the challenges these animals face. Working alongside local communities to educate people about rhino protection was incredibly meaningful.</p>

<div class="misc-card">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #20c997;"><i class="fas fa-seedling" style="margin-right: 8px;"></i>Greenie Environmental Club, Danang (2017)</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><i class="fas fa-seedling" style="color: #20c997; margin-right: 8px;"></i>This project holds a special place in my heart! During high school in Da Nang, I started the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenie.club" target="_blank">Greenie Environmental Club</a> because I wanted to create a space where students could learn about environmental issues and actually do something about them. We organized beach clean-ups, planted trees around the city, and held workshops to teach other students about sustainability. It was amazing to see how passionate everyone became about protecting our environment!</p>

### üìö Community Service
<div class="misc-card">
  <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #fd7e14;"><i class="fas fa-heart" style="margin-right: 8px;"></i>Volunteer Teacher for Street Children, Danang (2016-2017)</h4>
  <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><i class="fas fa-heart" style="color: #fd7e14; margin-right: 8px;"></i>During high school in Da Nang, I volunteered to teach street children, and it was incredibly amazing. These kids were so eager to learn despite their difficult circumstances. We'd help them with homework, but the most meaningful moments were the simple things - sharing meals together, decorating their homes for Tet holiday, and just being there to listen. The smiles on their faces made every moment worthwhile.</p>
